# Overview

This software is to fuel you gambling addiction. You are given $20 and you can do with it what you wish. More than likely you are going to lose it all. You will have to guess the correct number and you will continue to lose money until you do. When you finally get it right then you can leave.

I thought this would be a fun project to do to learn the basics of Java. I used simple if, then statements. A while loop. A function. It was a fun language to learn and add to my arsenal.

# Future Work

- This game was fairly simple. Next time I would like to create Yahtzee
- I want to figure out a better method to get user input, rather than Scanner.
- I want to make a more complex game. When I have more time.
